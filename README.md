# Road Segmentation Project

This repository contains the code for the Machine Learning project on road segmentation. We train a classifier that can provide a pixel-wise segmentation of roads from the background using a set of satellite images from GoogleMaps.

The dataset is available from the
[CrowdAI page](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/epfl-ml-road-segmentation).
